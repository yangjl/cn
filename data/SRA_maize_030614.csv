Highly significant genotypic variation in transcript expression was detected in over 25% of the 30,208 genes scanned. Of these, 3% were highly correlated with genotypic variation of kernels per row and grain weight per ear. Genes at the ramosa1 and ramosa2 loci, and a gene homologous to the ramosa3 locus, were conspicuous members of this set, substantiating that genotypic variation for lateral branch initiation in the ear shoot apical meristem is associated with variation of branching phenotype in the mature ear. A possible role of reactive oxygen signaling in lateral branch initiation is discussed."25,SRP026399,GSE48425: Dynamic Expression of Imprinted Genes Associates with Maternally Controlled Nutrient Allocation during Maize Endosperm Development,68.27,,University of Arizona,26,SRP010947,RNA-directed DNA methylation in near-gene chromatin regulation,65.61,,University of Georgia,27,SRP011560,The Zeanome,64.22,,Iowa State University,28,SRP010770,Differentiated Truncation and Uridylation Patterns of miRNAs in Arabidopsis and Rice hen1 Mutants Suggest miRNAs May Re-program RISC,62.32,152685,GEO,29,SRP022569,Zea mays subsp. mays Epigenomics,62.32,202919,University of Minnesota,"Experiment design:ÊWhole-genome bisulfite sequencing was performed adapting methods from Schmitz et al., 2011.

Most capture protocols require blocking DNA, the production of which in large quantities can prove challenging. A blocker-free, two-stage capture protocol was developed using NimbleGen arrays. The first capture depletes the library of repetitive sequences, while the second enriches for target loci. This strategy was used to resequence non-repetitive portions of an approximately 2.2 Mb chromosomal interval and a set of 43 genes dispersed in the 2.3 Gb maize genome. This approach achieved approximately 1800-3000-fold enrichment and 80-98% coverage of targeted bases. More than 2500 SNPs were identified in target genes. Low rates of false-positive SNP predictions were obtained, even in the presence of captured paralogous sequences. Importantly, it was possible to recover novel sequences from non-reference alleles.
